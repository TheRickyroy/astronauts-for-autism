## Project Outline

Astronauts for Autism is a fictional organisation dedicated to the support of autistic children and their families, with a primary focus on education and learning during weekly guided sessions. The page developed as part of this project documents the organisation's safeguarding policies and practices whilst offering information, support and contact options for children and parents alike.

The final deliverable as well as fulfilling the content requirements is responsive to modern device standards, adheres to accessibility requirements and is aesthetically pleasing with a focus on the needs and well-being of in the intended end-user.

### Key Objectives

- A positive and appropriate user experience for autistic children and families utilising effective navigation and layout
- Clear and concise presentation of content with easy to navigate options for additional information 
- Responsive design that adheres to all necessary standards and accessibility requirements
- Effective use of color and imagery ensuring consideration for the well-being of the end user
- Inclusion of user-initiated actions providing immediate feedback

## UX Design

## User Stories 

As a parent, I want to know the safeguarding measures in place so I can feel confident knowing my child will be safe during their guided sessions.

As a parent, I want to easily find additional resources to support my child knowing these will be similar to what they have already learned within the sessions to prevent confusion and frustration. 

As a child, I want to find resources that help me when I am feeling overwhelmed. 

As a child, I want to be able to talk to someone when I am scared and need help.

As a staff member, I want to be able to reassure children and parents that we provide a safe environment. 

As a staff member, I want to be able to provide an easy point of access to resources to supplement our sessions.

As a staff member, I want to provide an easy and secure method of communication, which may also include anonymity to protect those that feel unsafe.

## Colors

Color selection is a key component to any design process, however with the nature of the project this consideration is even greater due to the needs of the end user and the potential for negatively impacting their well-being. 

The artwork and color selection thus played a integral part in the design of this project as they were essential in creating a welcoming and appropriate page for the end user and their specific needs. After much research and inspiration, combining general color theory, autistic specific color theory, my own personal experience of working with autistic children and adults, as well as feedback, I was able to determine an appropriate color scheme that is aesthetically pleasing whilst being both calming and engaging. 

To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.<br>
Both the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

**Main Palette**

Deep Sky Blue #30C5FF | Pink Lavender #E4B7E5 | Russian Violet #381A46 | Spring Green #21F383 | Vanilla #EEEEA2

![Color Contrast Checker Results](/documentation/images/color-contrast.gif)

Due to the potential impact of color on autistic persons, additional research and feedback was sought out in order to ensure an appropriate selection was made for this project. Resources consulted can be found in the documentation for additional [research](/documentation/research.md).

## Fonts

As with color, font was a big consideration for ensuring a positive user experience whilst visiting the page.<br>
Two sans-serif fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.

[Fredoka](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka) serves as playful font to be used within logos, headings other page elements of significance.

[Prompt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt) is to be used as the primary content font ensuring ease of readability and complementing the Fredoka font choice.

### Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the key feature layout to guide the user experiende design. Utilising the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and available components allows for the construction of a page that feels familiar for ease of navigation whilst also allowing for well structured content and a responsive design.

## Deployment


This [GitHub](https://github.com/) project was created using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) ensuring all necessary dependencies were included when opening within the designated workspace on the [Gitopod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Setup a repo using this method and template:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Navigate to the Code Institute Full Template
3. Click the dropdown for 'Use this template' and select "Create a new repository"
4. Generate the necessary name and description for your repo and clicc 'Create repository from template'
5. Navigate to the new reop and click the green 'Open' button with the Gitpod logo<br>
**IMPORTANT - This button should only be clicked once to generate the new IDE workspace**
6. You can now work on your repository within the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace

Once the project repo is created, an early deployment for the live project should performed.<br>
This allows for early and continuous testing using a variety of devices, as well as the Dev Tools available within browsers.

Additional information on the deployment process can be found on the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
